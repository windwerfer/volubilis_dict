# volubilis_dict


unofficial dictionary (stardict/mdict) files for the volubilis project (https://belisan-volubilis.blogspot.com).<br><br><br>


<img src=''><br>
the dictioanry is bilangual (th-en, en-th) and has a Level to each word, judging how basic it is (B = basic, A1 = intermediate, A2 = advanced, s = special).<br><br><br>


<img src=''><br>
there is a pronounciation search. eg .maa (the sound of the thai word) would find มา, ม้า and หมา. almost every word has a pronuciation entry.<br><br><br>



this project converts the Volubilis Thai-English dictionary (released as spread sheat or pdf) to a standart dictionary format.<br><br><br>

<b>Install / use:</b>

If you want to create your own version of the dictionary files, i uploaded the converter scipt. it is written python and converts the spreadsheat into a tab separated txt file (one entry, one line). it also adds a reverse translation from English to Thai and a pronounciation search. eg .maa (the sound of the thai word) would find มา, ม้า and หมา<br><br><br>

the script was written without any thought of publishing it (bad coding, and lots of manual intervention, so just: for research purposes), but because i use the final product myself a lot, i thought i make it available.
